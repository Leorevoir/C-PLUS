# C+ CPA CPO ???

C+ (C-PLUS, file.cp) is a `high level` semi-object oriented compiled language with a syntax close to C and Ruby.

```rb
def main() -> int
{
    return 84;
}
```

CPA (file.cpa) is C+'s assembly file format containing CPU instructions.
CPO (file.cpo) is C+'s object binary file format.

# Why ?

We want C execution time with high level abstraction and high speed compilation.
We don't want C++ horrible debug messages and we don't want high-level language slooww compilation time.
